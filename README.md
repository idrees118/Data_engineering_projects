# Weather Data ETL Pipeline with Docker & PostgreSQL

This project showcases an end-to-end **ETL pipeline** that fetches weather data from an API, transforms it, and loads it into a **PostgreSQL** database. The entire setup runs inside **Docker containers** to ensure easy deployment, portability, and management.

## Demo Overview

- Key configurations with `docker-compose.yml` and `main.py`
- Dockerfile setup and PostgreSQL database initialization
- Running the ETL process and exporting data to CSV
- Exploring Docker volumes and containers to understand data persistence

## What I Learned

This hands-on project deepened my skills in:
- Containerized environments using Docker
- Database management with PostgreSQL
- Practical ETL workflows essential for data engineering roles
