Building a Weather Data ETL Pipeline with Docker & PostgreSQL
In this project, I developed an end-to-end ETL pipeline that fetches weather data from an API, transforms it, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database all running in Docker containers for easy deployment and management.
In the demo I walk through:
Key configuration with docker-compose.yml and main.py
Dockerfile setup and database initialization
Running the ETL process and exporting data to CSV
Exploring Docker volumes and containers to understand data persistence
This hands-on project helped me deepen my skills in containerized environments, database handling, and practical ETL workflows critical for any data engineering role.
Happy to connect and discuss more on scalable data pipelines.
